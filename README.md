# General Gameplaying Artificial Intelligence
Final project @ RU - Intelligent virtual human representation of GGP AI in a virtual environment

##How to run
###Prerequisites
* Unity 5
* Git bash (if on windows)
* Java SDK (make sure JAVA_HOME is defined in your environment variables to make life simpler)

###Steps
1. Clone the repository with git ( git clone https://github.com/HASParty/ggpai )
2. Navigate a bash console to the ggp folder ("Git bash here" in the ggp folder via the right-click context menu if you installed git bash) and run ./setup.sh - if it fails to find tools.jar, you don't have JAVA_HOME set or not even the JDK installed.
3. Wait for it to finish running.
4. Open the trunk folder as a project in the unity editor. Open the Menu scene in the scenes folder. Hit play.

##Keybindings
* SELECT: A on gamepad (face button bottom) / spacebar.
* RECENTER: Special left on gamepad / C on keyboard.
* DEBUG INFO: L to display debug information on mood and behaviour (hold right-click to disable camera movement to be able to look at the behaviour chunks).
* TOGGLE VISIBILITY: T on keyboard to toggle AI actor visibility.
