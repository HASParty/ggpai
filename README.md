# General Gameplaying Artificial Intelligence
Final project @ RU - Intelligent virtual human representation of GGP AI in a virtual environment

##How to run
###Prerequisites
* Unity 5
* Git bash (if on windows)
* Java SDK (make sure JAVA_HOME is defined in your environment variables to make life simpler)

###Steps
1. Clone the repository with git ( git clone https://github.com/HASParty/ggpai )
2. Navigate a bash console to the ggp folder ("Git bash here" in the ggp folder via the right-click context menu if you installed git bash) and run the following command:
*./gradlew clean && ./gradlew fatjar && mv build/libs/Jeff-all.jar ../Trunk/Assets/StreamingAssets/Jeff.jar*
3. Wait for it to finish running.
4. Open the trunk folder as a project in the unity editor. Open the Menu scene in the scenes folder. Hit play.

It should probably run now.
